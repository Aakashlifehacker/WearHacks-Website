                  WearHacks is an international, student run hackathon held in Montreal. A hackathon is an event where teams build cool stuff together for 36 hours- sleep is optional, making awesome things is not. WearHacks is focused on wearable and connected technologies.

                  No worries. It's definitely a plus to have prior coding or technical experience, but it's not a requirement. We'll have talks, mentors and workshops to help you with your project- Hackathons can be a great place to learn new skills in a short amount of time. Just come eager to learn, excited to meet lots of awesome people and most importantly, come ready to build.

                  For the first 180 persons, WearHacks will absolutely free! Price of admission is a "can do" attitude and a burning desire to get shit done. After that first 180 tickets are gone, the price will be $15 a ticket, with a *wink* special discount for student hackers. Contact us to get the discount code. :)

                  Not a problem. Sign up on the WearHacks SparkBoard. You can join projects if you don't have an idea or create a project if you have an idea but no team. Either way, you're good to go!

                  We do not have any specific requirements for team sizes, but keep in mind that the bigger your team the harder it will be to manage. We recommend a maximum team size of four people and encourage diversity.

                  The short answer is no. The long answer is that you can create projects and discuss your ideas on the WearHacks SparkBoard. We do not encourage participants to work on pre-existing projects as this goes against the spirit of hackathons. However, you can definitely familiarize yourself with the APIs, libraries and kits that you want to work on. We'll also be providing more info about the APIs that our sponsors will be providing, so stay tuned!

                  A group of judges will rate the hacks based on creativity, technical difficulty, design, and usefulness. Sponsors also evaluate projects that are competing for their respective prizes based on their own criteria. The top 10 overall projects will go to a final round of judging, where teams will demo what they built in front of all the judges and participants. We will be posting more details about our judges and judging categories closer to the event, along with what prizes are up for grabs.
