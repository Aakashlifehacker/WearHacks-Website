                  WearHacks is an international Montreal-based nonprofit organization whose mission is to make hardware education - with an emphasis on the domain of Wearable and Internet of Things technologies - accessible, approachable, and affordable to everyone.
                  Through our WearHacks hackathons, we give hackers access to cutting edge hardware devices with learning materials, create an environment whereby hackers feel comfortable exploring new domains, and reduce the price of experimentation and upfront investment from the hackers.

                  No worries. It's definitely a plus to have prior coding or technical experience, but it's not a requirement. We'll have talks, mentors and workshops to help you with your project- Hackathons can be a great place to learn new skills in a short amount of time. Just come eager to learn, excited to meet lots of awesome people and most importantly, come ready to build.

                  Not a problem. You can join projects if you don't have an idea or create a project if you have an idea but no team at the event. There will be a little mingling on Friday night - time for brainstorming and team forming. Either way, you're good to go!

                  We do not have any specific requirements for team sizes, but keep in mind that the bigger your team the harder it will be to manage. We recommend a maximum team size of four people and encourage diversity.

                  The short answer is no. We do not encourage participants to work on pre-existing projects as this goes against the spirit of hackathons. However, you can definitely familiarize yourself with the APIs, libraries and kits that you want to work on. We'll also be providing more info about the APIs that our sponsors will be providing, so stay tuned!

                  A group of judges will rate the hacks based on creativity, technical difficulty, design, and usefulness. Sponsors also evaluate projects that are competing for their respective prizes based on their own criteria. The top 10 overall projects will go to a final round of judging, where teams will demo what they built in front of all the judges and participants. We will be posting more details about our judges and judging categories closer to the event, along with what prizes are up for grabs.
